# API-Automation-Testing-with-Playwright
This project demonstrates automated API testing for the JSONPlaceholder (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) public mock API using Playwright. The tests cover CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the `/todos` endpoint and validate response status codes, body content, response structure, and performance metrics (response time).
